# Combat Tracker

A simple RPG combat and initiative tracker that stores some starter Heroes and Villains in a table and allows the user to edit/delete each character (row) or add new ones.
The characters should all be sorted by initiative value in descending order and be colored to reflect their status as Hero/Villain.

All rows should be completely editable. The edit button on the right will open up all fields to be edited. While in edit mode, both the edit and delete buttons will temporarily be changed to save buttons. The delete button will just remove the entire character/row from the table.
Add Hero! button will add a new character/row to the bottom of the list in the edit mode.
Add Villain! button will also add a new character/row to the bottom but the row should be colored differently.

TODO:   - Add colors to characters listed as Villains to differentiate.
        - Impliment row sorting by initiative.
        - Add more styling to page.
